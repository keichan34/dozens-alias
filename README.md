# Dozens::Alias

Dozens::Alias was an ALIAS record emulator for Dozens (a Japanese DNS hosting
company) that updated A records at the domain apex periodically. Now that Dozens
has [native support for ALIAS records](http://blog.dozens.jp/post/121313849283/aliasレコード機能を追加しました),
this library is deprecated.
